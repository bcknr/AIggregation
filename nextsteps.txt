now that we have adjusted our model to ideally work
WHICH ACTUALLY DO THAT

We can move on to our analysis and visualizations
goals are:
    - test images of large ortho
        - I think we just split/subset and run seperate validation tests on a labeled subset of the ortho
        - repeat this labeling with an undergrad, Dr (mark), and AI, doing in on a few images
            - compare time, accuracy
    - exporting bounding boxes from ortho back into some sort of coordinate based system
        - TM currently working on this with rasterio - working notebook created
    - kernal density estimation
    - nest heatmap

    
Step 1 for this would be to output bounding boxes into some coordinate form. from there things are easy

- one way we could do this is with good old math... 
- currently bounding boxes are saved as x and y of top left corner as a percent of pixles (0-1) and then x and y of box as a percent of image pixles (0-1)
- easier I think would be just put the ortho and bounding boxes into qgis and then georeference using gravestones as ground control points
    - this can be pretty easily done
